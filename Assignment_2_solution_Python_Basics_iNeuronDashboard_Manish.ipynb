    "The ‘break’ statement is a loop control statement, it is used to terminate or stop the loop or statement in which it is present. After that, it passes the control to the statements which are out of the loop and are present after the break statement, if any. It is used to terminate the loop statements like while and for.\n",
    "The ‘continue’ statement is just opposite to that of a break statement. Instead of terminating or stopping the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop while skipping the code inside the loop following the continue statement, and the next iteration of the loop will begin.\n",

    "Q11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",

    "Answer\n",
    "If we see it by shallow eyes and see only in regards to the arguments given, there is no difference as range(10), range (0,10), and range (0,10,1) all of these three return the same sequence from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first look what is range function and will define the actual difference among these three after that.\n",
    "range function in Python takes 3 arguments and they are initial value, final value, and increment value as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "•start: integer starting from which the sequence of integers starts and to be returned\n",
    "•stop: This is the integer which is outbound excluded which means this is excluded from the values returned in the final sequence. In other words, it stops at ‘stop – 1’ value.\n",
    "•step: integer value which determines the increment between each integer in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual difference comes into the picture when we change the value of arguments. \n",
    "So for range(10) it will print a sequence from 0 to 9, but for range(0,10), we can change the starting point as range(1,10), and therefore instead of returning a sequence from 0 to 9, it will now return the sequence from 1 to 9. \n",
    "Similarly, for range(0, 10, 1) it will return a sequence from 0 to 9 but if we change it to range(1, 10, 2) it will jump two steps from the starting argument given and will return the sequence from 1 to 9 with two steps at each next return. This difference is shown below by running the example code in the code section below.\n",
